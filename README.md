# PROUD: PaRallel OUtlier Detection for streams using Spark Streaming

**PROUD** is an open-source high-throughput distributed outlier detection engine for intense data streams that is implemented in Scala on top of the [Spark Streaming](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.4.5/streaming-programming-guide.html) framework.

The original implemementation was forked in this repository to be re-implemented substituting the Flink implementation using Spark Streaming

It supports distance-based outlier detection algorithms both for single-query and multi-query cases.
